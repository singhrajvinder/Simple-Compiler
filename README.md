# Simple-Compiler
code parser.cpp is the main file which will use the rest of the files to parse throught a .txt  and print if successfully parsed or print out errors if it wasnt parsed successfully. 
it is a simple compiler that can read a file and do simple assigning, printing, simple arithmetic sequences, and do if, then statements.
